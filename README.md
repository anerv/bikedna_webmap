# Web map with BikeDNA results

This repository contains the code and vector tiles for a [web map](https://anerv.github.io/bikedna_webmap/) with selected results from running [BikeDNA BIG](https://github.com/anerv/bikedna_big) on Danish bicycle infrastructure data (OSM and GeoDanmark).

The map has been developed based on this [guide](https://martinfleischmann.net/how-to-create-a-vector-based-web-map-hosted-on-github/).
